  problem_statement: |
    Medication non-adherence remains a major clinical and economic challenge across
    the U.S. healthcare system. Approximately 50% of patients do not take medications
    as prescribed, leading to avoidable hospitalizations, complications, and costs.
    Health systems lack a unified, clinically integrated tool to help patients stay
    on track and give clinicians real-time insight into adherence patterns.

  problem_context:
    impact: "Medication non-adherence affects approximately 50% of patients taking chronic medications, leading to poor clinical outcomes, increased readmissions, and avoidable healthcare costs. For high-risk conditions (diabetes, hypertension, post-operative recovery), small deviations from medication timing can meaningfully impact outcomes."
    affected_populations:
      - name: "Elderly adults with polypharmacy"
        size: "Primary target population"
        pain_points:
          - "Complex medication regimens with multiple drugs and timing requirements"
          - "Lack of visibility into daily medication schedules"
          - "No reminder system integrated with clinical care"
      - name: "Post-operative patients during recovery"
        size: "High-risk cohort"
        pain_points:
          - "Critical medication timing for recovery outcomes"
          - "Limited post-discharge support for adherence"
      - name: "Chronic condition patients (diabetes, hypertension)"
        size: "Large ongoing population"
        pain_points:
          - "Long-term adherence challenges"
          - "Lack of clinician visibility between visits"
      - name: "Clinicians and care coordinators"
        size: "Secondary users"
        pain_points:
          - "No real-time adherence data"
          - "Unable to identify at-risk patients proactively"
          - "Manual outreach workflows"
    consequences_of_inaction:
      - "Continued poor patient outcomes and increased complications"
      - "Avoidable readmissions affecting value-based care reimbursement"
      - "Failure to meet CMS and payer adherence reporting requirements"
      - "Lost revenue opportunities and regulatory non-compliance"
      - "Increased clinician burnout from reactive workflows"

  root_causes:
    - cause: "Fragmented, non-clinical reminder apps that don't integrate into care workflows"
      evidence: "Existing reminder apps are standalone consumer products without EHR integration or clinical oversight"
    - cause: "Clinicians lack visibility into patient behavior between visits"
      evidence: "Care teams have no real-time data on medication adherence patterns"
    - cause: "No unified platform integrating patient reminders with clinician dashboards"
      evidence: "Current tools are either patient-facing or clinician-facing, not both"
    - cause: "Medication data silos between EHR systems and patient apps"
      evidence: "Medication lists are authoritative in EHRs but not accessible to patients in actionable form"

  current_state:
    existing_solutions: |
      Current solutions include:
      - Consumer reminder apps (fragmented, non-clinical, no EHR integration)
      - Manual phone call outreach by care coordinators
      - Post-visit paper medication schedules
      - EHR patient portals (complex, not reminder-focused)
      None of these provide a unified, clinically integrated solution.
    gaps: |
      Existing solutions fail to:
      - Integrate medication schedules directly from EHRs
      - Provide real-time adherence visibility to clinicians
      - Support low-tech-literacy elderly populations effectively
      - Connect patient adherence data with care team workflows
      - Meet HIPAA and health system compliance requirements from day one
